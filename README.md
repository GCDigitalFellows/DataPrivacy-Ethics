# Data Privacy and Ethics of Remote Learning

<!---ABSTRACT--->
Learning to live with the pandemic is shaping to be our new reality. Given that we are likely to continue with some form of remote learning in the upcoming semester, it is important to consider how and why we are choosing to use particular platforms and tools. For example, in your course planning, have you considered how might you be generating "learning data" with the tools you've chosen? In addition to data privacy, does the platform or tool you are planning to use follow, at the minimum, a [universal design for learning](http://udlforteachers.com/)?    

As we move into the upcoming semester, we need to take a step back and look at what data we are (un)intentionally collecting of us and of our students as a result of hybrid and online learning environments. In this workshop, we will consider the dimensions of data privacy and ethics, particular of our students' learning data, in tandem with our need to utilize different remote learning platforms and tools. We will also discuss how we can make our remote learning environment more accessible.

## Learning Goals

<!---3 GOALS--->
- Reflect on the platforms and tools we are planning to use  
- Critically consider how student data are being recorded and used in the tools we choose   
- Critically consider what can make our remote teaching and learning environment accessible
