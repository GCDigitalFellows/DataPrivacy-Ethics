# Data Privacy and Ethics of Remote Learning

<!---ABSTRACT--->
Responding to the public health crisis caused by the coronavirus continues to reshape what it means to teach in higher education. This fall, courses will continue to be held online, and it is important to consider what digital platforms and tools we would like to use to teach in an online setting. Doing so responsibly means taking into consideration what the implications are for selecting each tool and challenging ourselves to prioritize using platforms that help keep student data private and safe. This workshop considers the pressing ethical and privacy questions that teachers should consider as they begin to move their courses online. For example, in your course planning, have you considered how might you be generating "learning data" with the tools you've chosen? In addition to data privacy, does the platform or tool you are planning to use follow, at the minimum, a [universal design for learning](http://udlforteachers.com/)?    

As we move into the Fall semester, we need to take a step back and look at what data we are (un)intentionally collecting of us and of our students as a result of hybrid and online learning environments. In this workshop, we will consider the dimensions of data privacy and ethics, particular of our students' learning data, in tandem with our need to utilize different remote learning platforms and tools. We will also discuss how we can make our remote learning environment more accessible.    


## Learning Goals

<!---3 GOALS--->
- Explore possible digital platforms to use in your course and assess what the possible tradeoffs are for using the tool. 
- Read sample privacy and data usage statements, and consider how student data are being recorded, stored, and repurpopsed by the digital platforms we use.   
- Review tenents of universal design and consider what can make our remote teaching and learning environment accessible to people with visual impairments, unstable internet connections, few technical skills, and more. 

## Introduction

<!---Intro + Suggested Warm-up Readings--->
When the transition to online teaching and learning first began, [a plethora of digital platforms and tools emerged](https://thejournal.com/articles/2020/03/13/free-resources-ed-tech-companies-step-up-during-coronavirus-outbreak.aspx?s=the_it_260320&oly_enc_id=6323B4729901J1A). From Zoom classes to Blackboard forum discussions, we were given a really short amount of time to "make do" and adapt our original syllabus. As we prepare for the upcoming semester with remote learning, we are at an opportune moment to pause and consider the resources at hand and the structures we might try for the classes we are teaching. Unlike the sudden switch in the previous semester where we were functioning mostly in a triage mode to convert our classes, we are (hopefully!) in a better place to take a step back from the pressures and time constraints of an emergency response to think through how might we facilitate remote learning. Many of us may have heard of the [security](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2020-03-27-holding-class-on-zoom-beware-of-these-hacks-hijinks-and-hazards) [vulnerabilities](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2020/04/safety-and-security-while-video-conferencing/) associated with Zoom, and while it is addressed in the [latest version](https://blog.zoom.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Security-90-day-Plan-Key-Updates.pdf), there are still concerns for using it as a platform for remote learning. For example, Zoom maintains a [Government Requests Guide](https://zoom.us/docs/en-us/government-requests-guide.html) that allows the government to request user information, including location data from Zoom about particular users. In choosing to use Zoom (and other similar platforms and tools), even within our educational settings, we are exposing ourselves and our students to additional vulnerabilities that differs from in-person class.   

As educators, considering how students' learning data can be accessed and used is an important part of creating a safe and equitable class environment. Recently, the [CUNY UFS Committee on Libraries and Information Technology](http://www1.cuny.edu/sites/cunyufs/committees/senate/standing/libraries-it/meetings-2019-2020/) produced a faculty senate resolution on student data to address concerns about using and working with third-party vendors in the creation of our remote learning environment. Primarily, we are not always aware of how "learning data," created in the course of fulfilling academic requirements, is being mined and captured by the platforms and tools we have integrated in our class. Considering that CUNY colleges serve a significant portion of undocumented and marginalized students, we need to be cautious with the learning data generated. Where are they stored? Who have access to the data? How would they have access?  

In addition, students' access to technology is unevenly distributed. We know that CUNY had taken steps to address this by [distributing laptops, chromebooks, and tablets in the previous semester](https://twitter.com/CUNY/status/1243611257686626306?s=20) but whether or not students will have continued access to computers and reliable internet in the upcoming semester is unclear. Hence, when we consider the platforms and tools to include in our course, we need to also think about how our students might access these materials. For example, might they be using their phones or tablets as the main device to access course material? If they're on limited internet access, can they stream or download video lectures?  

On top of considering the material accessibility, we should also consider how accessible our chosen tools and platforms are for students with different abilities in our classrooms. For example, is closed captioning available on your video lecture? Is the site you send your students to screen-reader friendly?   



## Activity

<!---Can I think of an interactive/application based theory??--->
Look through the privacy policy of a platform and/or tool you plan to use in your remote learning environment. You can find the privacy policy of some of the common platforms and tools that are used in the list below:  

- [Zoom](https://zoom.us/privacy)
- [Blackboard](https://help.blackboard.com/Privacy_Statement)
- [turnitin](https://help.turnitin.com/Privacy_and_Security/Privacy_and_Security.htm)
- [SafeAssign](http://www.blackboard.com/legal/cookies-privacy-safeassign.aspx)
- [Prezi](https://prezi.com/privacy-policy/201910_NL/)
- [YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9315727?hl=en&ref_topic=9386940)

As you read, make note: who has access to the data? Are we comfortable with the intended use of this data (e.g. access by dept)? Are we comfortable with the unintended use of this data (e.g. ICE)? How can we minimize unintended usage?

DI: This section is going in the right direction, but may need help, as few people read through these agreements. Could ou provide an example? What are some terms that the learner should be on the lookout for? 

What is the motivation for selecting this tool? Is it ease of your use? ease for the students? What compromises do we make with regard to privacy and data surveillance by making this choice? 

How are you protecting yours and your students' data as we engage in this remote environment? [Again, maybe an example would be good here] 
  
Find a website you are interested in having your students explore in your course, how did it fare against the [WAVE tool](https://wave.webaim.org/)?   

How does the mobile version (vice versa) of the platform you choose deliver the material of the course? Does it look the way you intended? If it does not, is the material still accessible/readable/understandable to whomever is navigating it?  

What are some restrictions of not having a laptop and internet in accessing your course? How can you modify/accommodate those needs?  


## Some Concluding Thoughts

<!---What I hope participant leave this workshop with--->
Introducing new technologies into courses means that we are introducing new questions to consider that don't always have "right" answers. Many times how you proceed is a matter of making a judgement call and assessing the context of your choice. In other words,there is no way to craft a universal guideline on data privacy and ethics in remote learning. What might work in one course may not work in another, and we learn when we can afford to, or have to, compromise with the platform and tools we employ. The point, though, is to consider what are the values of your pedagogical approach, and to ask yourself whether or not the technologies you use are in keeping with those values. 

Perhaps a useful way to consider our compromise is to also share it with our students so that they are aware of the concerns with and justifications for the tech we've chosen to use.  
[[Great, can you give an example of what this would look like?]]
